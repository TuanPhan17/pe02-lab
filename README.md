## 📘 Overview
This lab contains multiple beginner level Python exercises demonstrating the use of:  
- Variables and simple data types  
- User input

## 🧠 Completed Programs

✅ **1. Prime Number Checker** – Checks if a number entered by the user is prime or not using a simple loop and conditional logic.  

✅ **2. Fibonacci Sequence Generator** – Generates a sequence of Fibonacci numbers based on how many the user wants.  

✅ **3. Stage of Life Classifier** – Determines a person’s stage of life (baby, kid, teen, adult, elder) based on their age input.  

✅ **4. Movie Ticket Pricing** – Uses a loop to ask for age and outputs the correct movie ticket price or “free” if under 3.  

✅ **5. Pattern Printing Program** – Prints a star pattern using nested loops, building each row one star at a time.
