# 🧮 PE02 Lab – Variables, Data Types, User Input & Loops

**Course:** IS201 – Fundamentals of Computing  
**School:** City University of Seattle  
**Author:** Tuan Phan

## 📘 Overview
This lab contains multiple beginner-level Python exercises demonstrating the use of:
- Variables and simple data types  
- User input  
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  

Each exercise is built as part of the **main menu program**, allowing the user to select which section to run.

## 🧠 Current Progress
✅ **1. Prime Number Checker**  
- Prompts the user for a number  
- Checks if it’s prime or not using a simple loop  
- Outputs “PRIME” or “NOT PRIME” accordingly  

✅ **2. Fibonacci Sequence Generator**  
- Asks the user how many Fibonacci numbers to generate  
- Starts with 0 and 1, the first two numbers in the sequence  
- Uses a `while` loop to calculate and print each following number  
- Demonstrates variable updates (`first`, `second`, `next_number`) and counting logic  

✅ **3. Stage of Life Classifier**  
- Prompts the user for their age  
- Uses an `if-elif-else` chain to determine which life stage they fall under:  
  - `< 2` → Baby  
  - `2–3` → Toddler  
  - `4–12` → Kid  
  - `13–19` → Teenager  
  - `20–64` → Adult  
  - `65+` → Elder  
- Reinforces logical comparisons and clean condition ordering  

🕓 **Next up:** Movie Ticket Pricing and Pattern Printing programs.
